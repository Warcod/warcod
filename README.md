Hi, I'm Guido 👋

Born and based in Argentina (for now).

I’m not a developer, but I write code sometimes.

My long-term dream? Owning a small village in the Tuscan, making wine and cheese.

What does that have to do with TypeScript? No idea yet… but I’ll figure it out.

I’ve played more hours of **Dark Souls** and **League of Legends** than I’m willing to admit.

While some people were buying BTC in 2010, I was downloading **The Sims** from Softonic.
